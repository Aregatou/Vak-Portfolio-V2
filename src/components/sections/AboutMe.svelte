		<p>I build web applications that solve real problems and look great doing it.</p>

			For <strong>9 years</strong>, I've specialized in

			proving that accessibility and great design can absolutely go hand in hand.

			I built this portfolio from scratch with SvelteKit, containerized it with Docker,
			and deployed it on my own 38TB unRaid server running from my home labâ€”complete with 
			Nginx reverse proxy, SSL termination via Cloudflare, and automated DNS management.

			When I'm not coding, I bring the same problem-solving approach to woodworking and creative projects.
