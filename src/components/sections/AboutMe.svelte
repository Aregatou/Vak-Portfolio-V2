		<p>I build creative stuff that looks pretty good.</p>
		<p>
			For <strong>9 years</strong>, I've been working with
			<strong>508-compliant <a href="#clients">government contracts</a></strong>
			â€”proving that accessible design <em>doesn't have to be dull</em>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I built this portfolio from scratch using Svelte, packed it into an Nginx Docker container,
			and host it directly on my 38TB unRaid server right in my living room.
		</p>
		<p>
			While I think that's pretty cool, I'm also fairly confident making things with my hands too.
